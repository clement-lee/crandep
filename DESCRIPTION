Title: Network Analysis of Packages on CRAN
Version: 0.0.1

Description: The dependencies of CRAN packages can be analysed in a network fashion. Through scrapping the page of a package on CRAN, we can obtain the packages that it depends, imports, suggests, etc. By iterating this procedure over a number of packages, we can build the dependency network and represent it by a graph object, most easily through the igraph package. Subsequently, the dependency network can be visualised and analysed using social network analysis methods, enabling us to have a bird's-eye view of the CRAN ecosystem.
