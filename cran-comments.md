## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs or NOTEs locally.

There may be a NOTE similar to the one below. The URL concerned is for the list of all packages instead of 1 individual package, and therefore the canonical form is not possible. Also, in the two files where this URL is found, no changes have been made since the previous version.

=========================================
