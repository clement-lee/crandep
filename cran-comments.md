This is a first submission of version 0.1.1, with no ERRORs or WARNINGs, and possible NOTEs are explained below.





## checking CRAN incoming feasibility ... NOTE

- Regarding the NOTE below (between the two lines of equal signs), the URL concerned is for the list of all packages instead of 1 individual package, and therefore the canonical form is not possible. Also, in the first file where this URL is found, no changes have been made since the previous version.

=========================================
Found the following (possibly) invalid URLs:
  URL: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/available_packages_by_name.html
    From: man/cran_dependencies.Rd
          inst/doc/introduction.html
    Status: 200
    Message: OK
    CRAN URL not in canonical form
  The canonical URL of the CRAN page for a package is 
    https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=pkgname
==========================================





## checking for future file timestamps ... NOTE

The NOTE "unable to verify current time" is due to the resource http://worldclockapi.com/ being not available currently, and is not related to the changes made in this verison.
