\title{Survival function of discrete power law}
\usage{
Supp(x, u, alpha)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Vector of positive integers}

\item{u}{Scalar, non-negative integer threshold}

\item{alpha}{Scalar, a numeric value greater than 1.0}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of the same length as x
}
\description{
\code{Supp} returns the survival function at x for the discrete power law with exponent alpha, for values greater than or equal to u.
}
\details{
The survival function used is S(x) = Pr(X >= x), where X is a random variable following the discrete power law. The inclusion of x in the sum means S(x) may not necessarily equal to Pr(X > x) as the distribution is discrete. In the case of discrete power law, it can be shown that S(x) = hzeta(alpha, x)/hzeta(alpha, u), where hzeta is the Hurwitz zeta function i.e. hzeta(y, z) = z^(-y) + (z+1)^(-y) + (z+2)^(-y) + ...
